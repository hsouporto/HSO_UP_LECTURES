1. **Preprocessing (`cpp`):**
   - The C Preprocessor (`cpp`) performs preprocessing on the source code.
   - It handles directives like `#include`, `#define`, and `#ifdef`.
   - Use `-E` flag to stop after preprocessing, generating a preprocessed output file:
     ```shell
     gcc -E my_program.c -o my_program.i
     ```

2. **Compilation (`cc1`):**
   - The compiler proper (`cc1`) takes the preprocessed code and generates assembly code.
   - It parses the code, checks for syntax errors, and translates it into assembly.
   - Use `-S` flag to stop after compilation, generating an assembly file:
     ```shell
     gcc -S my_program.i -o my_program.s
     ```

3. **Assembly (`as`):**
   - The assembler (`as`) converts the generated assembly code into machine code.
   - It produces an object file (e.g., `.o` or `.obj`).
   - Use `-c` flag to stop after assembly, generating an object file:
     ```shell
     gcc -c my_program.s -o my_program.o
     ```

4. **Linking (`ld`) [For Multiple Files]:**
   - If your program consists of multiple source files or depends on external libraries, you need to link them together.
   - The linker (`ld`) resolves references between different object files and libraries, creating an executable.
   - Use `-o` flag to specify the output executable name:
     ```shell
     gcc -o my_program my_program.o my_library.o -lm
     ```

5. **Final Output:**
   - The final output is an executable binary named `my_program` in this example.
   - It can be executed on your system.

6. **Optional Optimization (`-O`) [During Compilation]:**
   - You can apply optimization flags (e.g., `-O2`, `-O3`) during compilation to optimize the generated code for better performance.
   - For example, to enable level 2 optimization:
     ```shell
     gcc -O2 my_program.c -o my_program
     ```

7. **Optional Debugging Information (`-g`) [During Compilation]:**
   - To aid in debugging, include debugging information in the output binary using the `-g` flag.
   - This information allows debugging tools to inspect variables and trace program execution.
   - For example, with debugging information:
     ```shell
     gcc -g my_program.c -o my_program_debug
     ```

8. **Optional Additional Flags and Options:**
   - Depending on your specific requirements, you can specify additional flags and options to control various aspects of compilation, such as include directories (`-I`), library directories (`-L`), and library names (`-l`).

Keep in mind that the exact commands and options may vary depending on your specific use case, and these are just examples to illustrate the compilation stages with flags in C.
